# kong-auth-request
A Kong plugin that make GET auth request before proxying the original request.

## Description
kong-auth-request is a reincarnation of [ngx http auth request](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html "ngx http auth request").    

Plugin takes GET http request with Authorization header and send it to auth service (url is taken from plugin  configuration), then if auth response status code is 200 then plugin routes original request to upstream service with headers (header names are taken from plugin configuration) from auth response.   
If auth response code is greater than 299 then auth response is returned to client and origin request is not passed to upstream.
